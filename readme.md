## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Django 4.x or later installed
- Virtual environment for dependency management (optional but recommended)
- SQLite (or any other DB backend of your choice)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/venkideshVenu/SixersClub.git
cd sixersclub
```

### Step 2: Set up a virtual environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment for the project:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install required dependencies

Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set up environment variables

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to store your environment variables. It should contain the following:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost, 127.0.0.1
```

Replace `your_django_secret_key` with your Django secret key. You can generate one using Django's `get_random_secret_key()`:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

### Step 5: Apply database migrations

Migrate the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 6: Create a superuser

To access the admin panel, create a superuser account:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to enter a username, email, and password.

### Step 7: Run the development server

Run the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser to access the platform.
