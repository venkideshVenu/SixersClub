                <h3>Overview of Twenty20 (T20) Cricket</h3>
                <p>Twenty20 cricket, often referred to as T20, is a thrilling, shortened format of the traditional game of cricket. It was introduced in 2003 by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to create a faster and more entertaining version of cricket. In a T20 match, each team is restricted to a single innings of 20 overs, making it the shortest format of professional cricket. The match typically lasts for around 3 hours, which is similar in duration to other popular sports events.</p>

                <p>The T20 format has been widely adopted for both domestic and international tournaments.
