                <h4>How the ICC World Test Championship Works</h4><br>
                <p>The ICC World Test Championship is structured around bilateral series played between the top Test-playing nations over a two-year period. Points are awarded for each match result, with teams earning points for wins, draws, and ties. The two teams with the most points at the end of the cycle qualify for the final, held at a neutral venue. The final is a five-day match that decides the Test champion of the world. This format brings structure and context to every Test match played, adding significance to each result.</p>
