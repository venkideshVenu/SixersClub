                    <li><strong>Balance Between Bat and Ball:</strong> The format allows for a balanced contest between aggressive batting and skillful bowling, with periods of the game focusing on powerplay, consolidation, and acceleration phases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Play:</strong> Teams often use a mixture of power hitting and calculated plays, with captains needing to manage resources carefully over the full 50 overs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Matches last around 7-8 hours, typically split into two innings with a break in between.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global Popularity:</strong> ODIs are a staple in international cricket, with marquee tournaments like the Cricket World Cup drawing massive audiences worldwide.</li>
